We don't want that since each of the detail view will be fetching data from the internet for details. We only want that DetailView to be created for item/meal we tap.

That allMeals is in the MealDataService class which has all meals period.

So we are passing the meal to the MealRowView because if it has access to the "meal" object then it can show all three properties in each row. We will just show 2 though - name,img
